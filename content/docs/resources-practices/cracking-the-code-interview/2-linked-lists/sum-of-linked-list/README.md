# Sum of reversed order linked list 

You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit.

The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1â€™s digit is at the head of the list.

Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.

EXAMPLE
Input: `(3 -> 1 -> 5)`, `(5 -> 9 -> 2)`
Output: `8 -> 0 -> 8`

## Solution
