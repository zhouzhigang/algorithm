## how to Approach

Trees and grphs questions typically come in one of two forms:

1. Implement a tree / find a noe / delete a node / other well known algorithm.

2. Implement a modification of a known algorithm.

## Warning: Not all binary trees are binary search trees.

## Binary Trees - "Must Know" algorithms

* __In-Order__: Traverse left node, current node, then right[usually used for binary search trees]

* __Pre-Order__: Traverse current node, then left node, then right node.

* __Post-Order__: Traverse left node, then right node, then current node.

* __Insert Node__: On a binary search tree, we insert a value v, by comparing it to the root. If v > root, we go right, and else we go left. We do this util we hit an empty spot in the tree.

## Graph Traversal - "Must Know" Algorithms

* __Depth First Search__: DFS involves searching a node and all its children before proceeding to its siblings.

* __Breadth First Search__: BFS involves searching a node and its siblings before going on to any children.
