## Description

Given an array `S` of `n` integers, are there elements `a`, `b`, `c` in `S` such that `a + b + c = 0`?

Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Note:

* Elements in a triplet (a,b,c) must be in non-descending order. (ie, a ≤ b ≤ c)

* The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

    For example, given array S = {-1 0 1 2 -1 -4},

        A solution set is:
        (-1, 0, 1)
        (-1, -1, 2)
