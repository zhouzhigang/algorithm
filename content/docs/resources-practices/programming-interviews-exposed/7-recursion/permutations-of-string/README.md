## Problem

Implement a routine that prints all possible orderings of the characters in a string.

Treat each character in the input string as a distinct character, even if it is repeated.
Given the string "aaa", your routine should print "aaa" six times.
You may print the permutaions in any order you choose.

## Analysis

Take "hat" for example,
